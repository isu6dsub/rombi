Thresholding in OpenCV:


Houghs Transform with OpenCV:
  https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_houghlines/py_houghlines.html

Process:
  1. Convert to HSV.
  2. Threshold the HSV image for our experimentally-determined acceptable range for tape color.
  3. Use Canny edge detection (provided by OpenCV) to detect the edges of the tape.
  4. Use Houghs Transform (provided by OpenCV) to calculate the rho and phi for one of the lines in the Canny edges.
